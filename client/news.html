 <p>While New York City had its <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hundreds-homeless-bitterly-cold-nyc-streets-article-1.2531550" >coldest start to Valentine’s Day in 100 years</a> on Sunday, it would seem balmy compared with the wicked wind chill at upstate Whiteface Mountain.</p>

<p>As temperatures dropped across the Northeast from the blast of a polar vortex, the wind chill at Whiteface, near Lake Placid, made it feel like a body- and mind-numbing minus 114 degrees late Saturday and into Sunday. Central Park could only muster a minus 1 degree.</p>

<p>The Wild Center, which works with the Atmospheric Science Research Center at SUNY Albany, recorded the frigid temperature from a research station at the mountain’s summit.</p>
